## About

Lard Chat real-time chat application built with `React`, `Firebase`, `Tailwind CSS`, and hosted on `Vercel`, featuring email authentication, a live chatroom, and a user-friendly UI.

Some of the challenges I faced were learning how to take full advantage of the features that Firebase has to offer and getting the authentication set up when connecting to the Firestore database.

## How it works

Anyone can visit and use the chat room here [Lard Chat](https://lardchat.vercel.app/).

You can Register with an email and password and create a username.
When someone else registers you can simply search their username and begin a conversation in real time.
